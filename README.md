# Tio-EDC USB
Essential files and data to carry on your Every Day Carry housed on a USB drive or SD Card.

No encryption is used to make the Tio-EDC as plug-and-play as possible: In an emergency or under duress trying to enter a decryption passphrase or even getting it to work will be an issue.

The naming convention of the files and folders are formulated in such a way that it makes them as easy to read as possible in the shortest amount of time.


There are no original ideas left, only appropriations from giants. This REPO was inspired by hermanos Calderon.
This REPO is not intended for some kook clad in camo and rhetoric inside a bunker, but rather for the good people who we need to survive.


/ or Root Folder
----------------
In the root of the repo by default is an audio file called Mosquito-Tone-5min.mp3. The file is located in the root in order for it to hopefully autoplay when inserted into a device. Some devices such as mobile speakers or smart TV's will look into the root
of a device and start playing the audio automatically. Swap out with the other files from the ADIO folder as you see fit.

The Mosquito tone itself emits a high pitched tone that only someone around or under the age of 21yo can hear. The intent is to either distract/disperse or call attention.
