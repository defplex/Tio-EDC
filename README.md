# Tio-EDC USB
Valueable files and data to carry on your EDC USB or SD Card

No encryption is used to make the Tio-EDC as plug-and-play as possible: In an emergency or under duress trying to enter a decryption passphrase or even getting it to work will be an issue.

The naming convention of the files and folders are formulated in such a way that it makes them as easy to read as possible in the shortest amount of time.

/ or Root
---------
In the root of the repo by default is an audio file called Mosquito-Tone-5min.mp3. The file is located in the root in order for it to hopefully autoplay when inserted into a device. Some devices such as mobile speakers or smart TV's will look into the root
of a device and start playing the audio automatically. 

The Mosquito tone itself emits a high pitched tone that only someone around or under the age of 21yo can hear. The intent is to either distract/disperse or call attention. This file can be swapped out with the White-Noise.mp3 file which is included since it overrides other sounds, can help assist with sleep and cause audio clarity issues for listening devices or humans. Also included is an alarm sound and S-O-S in morse code.
