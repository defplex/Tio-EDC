# Tio-EDC USB
Valueable files and data to carry on your EDC USB

The contents of this drive are not encrypted to make it as plug-and-play as possible - In an emergency or under duress trying to enter a decryption passphrase or even getting it to work will be an issue.

The naming convention of the folders is formulated in such a way that it makes them easy to read in the shortest amount of time.

/ - In the root of the repo by default is an audio file called Mosquito-Tone-5min.mp3. The file is located in the root in order for it to hopefully autoplay into a device the Tio-EDC USB is plugged into. Some devices such as mobile speakers or smart TV's will look into the root
of a device and start playing the audio. The Mosquito tone itself emits a high pitched tone that only someone around or under the age of 21yo can hear. The intent is to either distract/disperse or call attention. This file can be swapped out with the White-Noise.mp3 file which is included since it overrides other sounds, can help assist with sleep and cause audio clarity issues for listening devices or humans.
