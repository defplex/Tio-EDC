Linear Master Key
=================

This is the master key to Linear Access Control devices, now rebranded as Nortek. Linear devices secure a large percentage of residential and commercial facilities across the US. This master key has been recreated from measurements taken from a key purchased from an online distributor of access control products. Because I do not have the bitting code for this key, and because the cuts are tinier than calipers can fit into, the key is not an exact replica. This key has been tested and reliably works on models such as the AE-100, AE-500, AE-2000, and more.
